'AI Reviewer Notebook Report'

    "This report provides an overview and analysis of the Jupyter notebook 'ai_reviewer_main.ipynb'. "
    "The notebook's goal is to recommend the top 3 cars based on user preferences by leveraging data cleaning, "
    "sentiment analysis, topic modeling, clustering, and a prototype deployment setup."
    "• MLflow Integration: The notebook uses MLflow to track experiments and log metrics.\n"
    "• Data Sources: Primary datasets include 'all_sampled_cars.csv' and 'hour2_cardiff_sentiment.csv'.\n"
    "• Cleaning Steps: Columns are standardized, missing values handled, and text fields prepared for analysis."
# Data Integration
    "• Merging: Reviews and vehicle details are merged into a unified DataFrame.\n"
    "• Feature Extraction: Regular expressions parse 'vehicle_title' to extract year, make, and model of each car."
# Sentiment Analysis
    "• Pipeline Setup: A three-way sentiment analysis pipeline is built using Hugging Face transformers.\n"
    "• Metrics Logged: Accuracy, latency, and throughput are measured and recorded via MLflow for each model tested."
# Topic Modeling and Clustering
    "• TF-IDF Vectorization: Review texts are vectorized to capture term importance.\n"
    "• Dimensionality Reduction: Truncated SVD reduces the vector space for efficient clustering.\n"
    "• Clustering: KMeans (k=7) groups make-model combinations based on topic-count distributions."
    "• Recommendation Logic: Based on selected topics and clusters, the system ranks and selects the top 3 cars.\n"
    "• Deployment Stub: Includes a Streamlit app scaffold and integration point with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for user interaction."
    "• Cluster Insights: The seven clusters align with user concerns such as comfort, performance, reliability, "
    "and design.\n"
    "• Sentiment Trends: Positive sentiment dominates clusters associated with high user satisfaction.\n"
    "• Model Recommendations: The prototype successfully identifies top make-model combinations "
    "tailored to user-selected preferences."
